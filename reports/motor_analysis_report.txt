    - Single motor: 14 (18.2%)
    - No motors detected: 16 (20.8%)
    
    Motor Detection:
    - Total motors detected: 310
    - Small motors: 250 (80.6%)
    - Large motors: 60 (19.4%)
    
    Mixed Images Statistics:
    - Average motors per mixed image: 6.3
    - Max motors in single image: 18
    - Avg small motor proportion: 80.7%
    - Avg large motor proportion: 19.3%
    

RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
1. The model successfully detects and classifies motors in mixed images
2. For production use, consider annotating 20-30 more images
3. The high proportion of small motors (80.7%) in mixed images is consistent
4. Single motor images can be processed with the binary classifier for efficiency
